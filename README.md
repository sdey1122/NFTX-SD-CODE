NFTX – A Modern, Responsive NFT Marketplace Website

NFTX is a modern, interactive NFT marketplace frontend project designed to showcase trending NFT auctions, featured artists, and community engagement — all wrapped in a sleek dark-themed aesthetic.
Built with a modular structure and reusable components, it provides a realistic web app feel using pure frontend technologies.

This project demonstrates professional-level frontend design, layout control, and animation mastery — integrating Bootstrap for structure, Swiper.js for dynamic sliders, and Font Awesome for icons, with custom JS for animations and counters.

The website includes:

🌐 A fixed gradient navbar with smooth hover effects and animated active states.

🎨 A banner section highlighting key messages and statistics with animated counters.

💎 A marketplace section built with Swiper.js, featuring multiple responsive cards and smooth autoplay sliders.

📈 Artist cards with animated stats and call-to-action buttons.

📰 A newsletter section integrated with attractive CTA form.

🧍‍♂️ A footer section with social media integration, Font Awesome icons, and full responsiveness across breakpoints.

⚙️ Custom animations and micro-interactions using CSS transitions and JavaScript triggers.
